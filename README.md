# TDTSandwich
An open source and modular system for heating samples with dry heat at a controlled heating rate. The full repository that includes bills of material and links to other components of the system can be found at https://osf.io/5q3y7/.

This repository contains the Arduino code that should be uploaded to the Arduino Nano used in each TDT Sandwich. The computer program for controlling the system is at https://github.com/kiatAWDSA/TDTSandwich_computer/.
